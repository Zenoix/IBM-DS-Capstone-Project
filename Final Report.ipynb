    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of IBM's professional certificate for data science, I was required to complete this capstone project where I had to analyse housing and building complaints in the state of New York. I was given information such as metadata of each complaint made for a house and the details about the buildings like the location, year it was built etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context of the Project\n",
    "```\n",
    "The people of New York use the 311 system to report complaints about the non-emergency problems to local authorities. Of those complaints, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City is the agency that processes 311 complaints that are related to housing and buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few years, the number of 311 complaints coming to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has increased significantly. Although these complaints are not necessarily urgent, the large volume of complaints and the sudden increase is impacting the overall efficiency of operations of the agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has approached your organization to help them manage the large volume of 311 complaints they are receiving every year. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By analysing existing data from the New York Department of Housing Preservation and Developing, I attempted to answer these questions posed by the department:\n",
    "- What type of complaint should be focused on first?\n",
    "- Should the department focus on any particular geographical area (borough, Zip codes, or street) for the determined complaint type?\n",
    "- Is there any obvious relationship between the characteristics of a house or building and the complaint type?\n",
    "- Can a predictive model be created for future possible complaints of the determined complainted type?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Results\n",
    "From analysing the data, it was discovered that complaints relating to heating occured the most with over 2,149,424 complaints compared to next highest with only 711,141 complaints in comparison. Regarding the locations where complaints occured\n",
