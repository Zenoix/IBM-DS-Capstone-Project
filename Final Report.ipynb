    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of IBM's professional certificate for data science, I was required to complete this capstone project where I had to analyse housing and building complaints in the state of New York. I was given information such as metadata of each complaint made for a house and the details about the buildings like the location, year it was built etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    ">The people of New York use the 311 system to report complaints about the non-emergency problems to local authorities. Of those complaints, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City is the agency that processes 311 complaints that are related to housing and buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the last few years, the number of 311 complaints coming to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has increased significantly. Although these complaints are not necessarily urgent, the large volume of complaints and the sudden increase is impacting the overall efficiency of operations of the agency.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Therefore, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has approached your organization to help them manage the large volume of 311 complaints they are receiving every year. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By analysing existing data from the New York Department of Housing Preservation and Developing, I attempted to answer these questions posed by the department:\n",
    "- What type of complaint should be focused on first?\n",
    "- Should the department focus on any particular geographical area (borough, zip codes, or street) for the determined complaint type?\n",
    "- Is there any obvious relationship between the characteristics of a house or building and the complaint type?\n",
    "- Can a predictive model be created for future possible complaints of the determined complainted type?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prediction Model Results\n",
    "For binary target (complaint made or not):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression: Jaccard score of 0.989, F-1 score of 0.99\n",
    "\n",
    "For predicting the number of complaints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. K-Nearest Neighbors: accuracy score of 0.97\n",
    "2. Multiple linear regression: Residual sum of squares of 25923.79, variance score of 0.08\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complaint Type Result\n",
    "From analysing the data, it was discovered that complaints relating to heating occured the most with over 2,149,424 complaints compared to next highest with only 711,141 complaints in comparison. From this, it was determined that heating complaints was going to be focused on in answering the questions that the department provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geographical Results\n",
    "Regarding the locations where these complaints occured, the Bronx had the most amount of complaints with Brooklyn having the second most followed by Manhatten, Queens, and then Staten Island. \n",
    "The 5 zip codes with the highest complaint numbers were: \n",
    "1. 11226: 69041 complaints\n",
    "2. 10467: 66073 complaints\n",
    "3. 10458: 65372 complaints\n",
    "4. 10468: 58190 complaints\n",
    "5. 10453: 57818 complaints\n",
    "\n",
    "and the 5 streets with the most complaints were:\n",
    "1. GRAND CONCOURSE: 37863 complaints\n",
    "2. BROADWAY: 24484 complaints\n",
    "3. OCEAN AVENUE: 18716 complaints\n",
    "4. MORRIS AVENUE: 16409 complaints\n",
    "5. ARDEN STREET: 15963 complaints\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the number of heating complaints for each borough, I would suggest the Department to focus on the **Bronx Area**.\n",
    "Looking at the number of complaints per zip code, the zip codes with the most complaints are **11226** located in Brooklyn, and 10467 located in the Bronx.\n",
    "Lastly, going off the streets with the most amount of complaints, the **Grand Concourse** has the highest amount of complaints with Broadway second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis of Correlations Between Building Characteristics and Complaints\n",
    "In order to discover whether there is a relationship between characteristics and complaints, I used two approaches:\n",
    "1. Use a binary approach where the features will either end in a complaint being made(represented by a 1) or not (represented by a 0)\n",
    "2. Using total number of complaints for each street to analyse correlation\n",
