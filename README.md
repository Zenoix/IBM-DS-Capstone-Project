# IBM DS Capstone Project

## Introduction
This repository holds the notebook files for the capstone project that is part of my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. Keep in mind that this is the first project I have ever done in the field of data science and I am still quite new so it won't be perfect however, any feedback is greatly appreciated. Also as this is a repo based on the course's requirements, some aspects of a normal data science project may be absent in this repo or incomplete altogether.

## Problem Statement
The people of New Yorker use the 311 system to report complaints about the non-emergency problems to local authorities. Various agencies in New York are assigned these problems. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City is the agency that processes 311 complaints that are related to housing and buildings.

In the last few years, the number of 311 complaints coming to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has increased significantly. Although these complaints are not necessarily urgent, the large volume of complaints and the sudden increase is impacting the overall efficiency of operations of the agency.

Therefore, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has approached your organization to help them manage the large volume of 311 complaints they are receiving every year.

The agency needs answers to several questions. The answers to those questions must be supported by data and analytics. These are their  questions:

1. Which type of complaint should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on first?
2. Should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or street (where the complaints are severe) for the specific type of complaints you identified in response to Question 1?
3. Does the Complaint Type that you identified in response to question 1 have an obvious relationship with any particular characteristic or characteristics of the houses or buildings?
4. Can a predictive model be built for a future prediction of the possibility of complaints of the type that you have identified in response to question 1?

Your organization has assigned you as the lead data scientist to provide the answers to these questions. You need to work on getting answers to them in this Capstone Project by following the standard approach of data science and machine learning.

## Datasets Used

I have used two datasets that the course provided in this project.

### 311 complaint dataset

The dataset I used was already placed on an IBM server which is where I got it from. You can download the data using this link: https://cocl.us/311_NYC_Dataset. The downloaded data will have complaints submitted between 2010 and 2020.
The original dataset is available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9. You can download part of this data by using SODA API.

### PLUTO dataset for housing

The dataset I downloaded comes from here: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/zip/data-maps/open-data/nyc_pluto_18v1.zip.
The original dataset for housing can be accessed from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Primary-Land-Use-Tax-Lot-Output-PLUTO-/xuk2-nczf.
